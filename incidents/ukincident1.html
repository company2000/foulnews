            <p>During the fatal friday of the 13th of October 2024, a 12 year old boy who goes by the same Bobby was ran over by a white car while he was walking over to his mother's car. A few moments after this all began, a red haired teenager ran over to Bob's body and stole his phone from his pocket. no-one knows why he thought this would be funny but he then proceeded to message Bobby's friends and pretent to be him causing a lot of trouble as you can probably imagine. A photo of this teenager can be found to the right.</p>
